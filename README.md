- 👋 Hi, I’m @markmartorilopez

- 👀 I’m interested in improving my knowledge about extracting valuable information from different types of datasets, mainly in Computer Vision.
 
      - From applying Deep Learning approaches such as spoting and classifying tumors in MRIs, or using Vision Transformers with OCR to translate images into text, to participating in virtual reality building scenarios.
      
      - At the same time, the world of Generative Adversarial Networks sounds really interesting to me!
      
- 🌱 After my Masters in Data Science and as an intern, I’m currently improving the in-depth concepts of Vision Transformers in Deep Learning with IBM Research under the supervision of Dr.Daniel Probst in the Accelerated Discovery Team. Delivering a digital tool called OChemR, check the open-sourced version at my repositories.
      
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate in enthusastic projects concerning Computer Vision. I feel specially interested on AR and VR.
