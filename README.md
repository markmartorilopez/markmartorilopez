- 👋 Hi, I’m @markmartorilopez

- 👀 I’m interested in improving my knowledge about extracting valuable information from different types of datasets, mainly in Computer Vision.
      - From applying Deep Learning to Images such as spoting and classifying tumors in MRIs to using Vision Transformers to translate images into text ...
      - At the same time, the world of Generative Adversarial Networks sounds really interesting to me!
      
- 🌱 After my Masters in Data Science, I’m currently improving the in-depth concepts of Vision Transformers in Deep Learning with IBM Research under the supervision of Dr.Daniel Probst in the Accelerated Discovery Team.
      - and doing a Master of Data Science in UZH and ETH.
      
- 💞️ I will be looking to collaborate in enthusastic projects once I build up all these knowledge within me.
