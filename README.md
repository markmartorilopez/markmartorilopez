- 👋 Hi, I’m @markmartorilopez

- 👀 I’m interested in using Machine Learning to tackle client's needs with a direct outcome, mainly in Computer Vision and NLP.

- 📁 Recent Projects in 2022:
   - Automatize the creation of on-demand chemical reactions data sets using Vision Transformers and OCR.
   - Object detection and classification benchmark with Vision Transformers, Faster-RCNN, RetinaNet, YOLOv4 and feature detectors.
   - Creation of faces that do not exist with a Progressive-Growing GAN (Team Project).
   - Playground for Deep Reinforcement Learning experiments, mimicking behavioural tasks in neuroscience.
      
- 🌱 After my Masters in Data Science and as an intern, I’m currently improving the in-depth concepts of Vision Transformers in Deep Learning with IBM Research under the supervision of Dr.Teodoro Laino in the ML Accelerated Discovery Team. Delivering a digital tool called OChemR, check the open-sourced demo-version at my repositories.
      
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate in enthusastic projects concerning Computer Vision and NLP.
